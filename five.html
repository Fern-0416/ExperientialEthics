        &emsp;The purpose of this project is to spread awareness of some possible issues that accomanpy the increasing digitalization of our society. This is a cautionary website that goes over real issues that can occur if companies grow unsupervised and unchecked.  <br> 
        &emsp;Additionally, I hope website encourages collective action, boycotts, and other protests against unjust corporations when they try to take advantage of the consumer. <br><br>

        &emsp; Legally I would hope to see companies be prohibited from adding terms and conditions that extend beyond what is reasonable or expected of them. Our rights are important, and we should not be tricked into waving them unintentionally.
