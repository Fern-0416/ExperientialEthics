    <div id="definitionTOS" class="definition"><h3>Definition: TOS</h3>&emsp;&emsp;A TOS agreement, as you just saw, is a legal agreement between a service provider and a user of the presented service. The user needs to agree to the agreement in order to access such a service. The intended purpose of such agreement is to protect the service provider from certain legal action, and also serves as a general disclaimer.</div>

    <div id="blurb2_1">&emsp;The TOS agreement you were just presented is, obviously, fake. In case you didn't notice, within that legal jargon is the statement: "The user also agrees to forfeit all intillectual rights of their next unborn child, such that all intellectual property belongs to Internet and Consent." Whether such a statement could be upheld is dubious, but the idea remains that companies can sneak in clauses and terms to take advantage of the user however they wish. In idea, this is because you already consented to such terms, despite not having read them. </div>

        <div id="videotext">The following YouTube video is a scene from Netflix's Black Mirror episode "Joan is Awful", where the main character Joan learns that her life is recorded by the technology around her, which a corporation known as StreamBerry exploits to quickly make a drama. In essence, Joan is taken advantage of via the TOS agreement she absent-mindedly agreed to.</div>
