    <div id="definitionTOS" class="definition"><h3>Definition: TOS</h3>&emsp;&emsp;A TOS agreement is a legal agreement between a service provider and a user of the presented service. The user needs to agree to the agreement in order to access such a service. It's purpose is to protect the service provider from certain legal actions, and also serves as a general disclaimer.</div>

    <div id="blurb2_1">&emsp;The TOS agreement you were just presented is, obviously, fake. In case you didn't notice, within that legal jargon is the statement: "The user also agrees to forfeit all intillectual rights of their next unborn child, such that all intellectual property belongs to Internet and Consent." Whether such a statement could be upheld is dubious, but the idea remains that companies can sneak in clauses and terms to take advantage of the user however they wish. In idea, this is because you already consented to such terms, despite not having read them. </div>

        <div id="videotext">The following YouTube video is a scene from Netflix's Black Mirror episode "Joan is Awful", where the main character Joan learns that her life is recorded by the technology around her, which a corporation known as StreamBerry exploits to quickly make a drama series. In essence, Joan is taken advantage of via the TOS agreement she absent-mindedly agreed to.</div>

    <div id="blurb2_2">
        &emsp; The legality behind these agreements on the internet lie in the user's consent; if you agree to the terms established by a company, you may use their service. For example, if you go to a trampoline park, you agree to abide by their rules and cannot pursue legal action against them if you are harmed while breaking such rules. Such an approach to the purposeful waiver of rights follows that the individual can self-manage their rights in real life and on the internet. <br><br>
        &emsp;However, many companies take advantage of this by imbuing complex legal jargon and absurdly long texts in their TOS agreements, making it significantly more difficult for most people to understand what they are reading. Additionally, with the  high number of TOS agreements most people face on a daily basis and the frequency of updates and changes, it is unreasonable to expect the individual to spend so much time reading and understanding them. This means that most people are left to hope that the company whose TOS agreement they're signing holds the best interests of the consumer, which is not always the case. <br><br>
        &emsp; Nonetheless, these agreements don't exist to be a nuissance to a consumer; they are necessary for companies and service to function smoothly. For example, if the trampoline park didn't have that agreement, a customer could get themselves hurt on purpose and sue the company. The user is in the wrong and the company can only protect themselves via preestablished terms under which a user may use their service.

    <div id="definitionConsent" class="definition"><h3>Definition: Consent</h3>Consent generally refers to a given permission for something to happen between two or more involved parties. There are varying contexts for consent, such as in relationships, medical decisions, and digital spaces. Consent must be explicitly given and can be revoked at any time.</div>
    <div id="blurb2_3">&emsp; In this context, consent refers to the individual's purposeful waiver of rights and acceptance of a set of given conditions, generally through signing a legal document. However, how much power can be given to the legal document when the service seems simple and all you have to do is click "agree"? In other words, there is a difference between you signing the papers to purchase a car, and clicking "agree" on the TOS of a Netflix subscription. I contend that differends needs to be further analyzed to limit corporations abilities in legal contexts.</div>
