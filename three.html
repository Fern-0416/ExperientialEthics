            &emsp;Earlier this year, a woman named Kanokpron Tangsuan ate at a restaurant in Disney's Orlando resort that was advertised to be allergen-free. She has a severe nut and dairy allergy, and tragically died of an allergic reaction from that restaurant. Her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, proceeded to sue Walt Disney Parks and Resorts over this incident. However, Disney responded with evidence of him signing up for a free trial of Disney+, whose TOS agreement states to settle any disputes out of court. <br>

            <!-- <div id="DisneyS">Jeffrey Piccolo and Kanokporn Tangsuan</div> -->
        <div class="DisneyP">
            &emsp;Such a dispute has terrible implications: if it were to be successfully disputed, then all 153 million subscribers of Disney+ and more would be incapable of going to court against Disney for any reason. Fortunately however, Disney dropped this request in this request, recognizing the wrong done to Piccolo. See <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/nyregion/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-arbitration.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/nyregion/disney-arbitration-allergy-death-lawsuit.html">here</a> from NY Times<br>
            &emsp; This is a real example of how users can be taken advantage of through the fine print of TOS agreements, and companies should be held accountable for such absurd requests.

    <div id="blurb3_1">
        Of course, not all TOS agreements have ulterior motives and are evil; there are mutiple stakeholders, values, and power dynamics at play in this conflict with consent agreements. <br><br> The stakeholders are: 
        <ul>
            <li>The user of a company's service: waivers the rights that the company outlines, is at risk of waivering more rights that he intended</li>
            <li>Those related to the user: WHichever way the user is affected through his business with a company may indirectly affect those close to him. For example, in the Disney example, both the husband and the wife's families could benefit from the lawsuit money, and they would be in a worse position had the case been dropped due to having a free trial of Disney+</li>
            <li>The employyes and employers of the company: TOS and other types of agreements exist fundamentally to protect a company. However strong that protection is affects the well-being of that company</li>
            <li>The shareholders of said company: Once again, the well-being of the company affects it's stocks, value, and assets, which depends on the level of their protection</li>
        </ul>
        Some core values are:
        <ul>
            <li>Freedom: The freedom of the individual is intrinsically tied to his rights, and by signing consent agreements with businesses, he may lose some of his rights. To best satisfy this ethical lens, the individual should need to waver as few rights as possible within reason. Similarly, the freedom of a company is also constrained to their rights, although they actually gain freedom through these agreements. Ideally, this freedom is to provide users with end-to-end, smooth, and promised experiences/services without putting the service provider at jeopardy.
            </li>
            <li>Justice: Both the user and the company deserve to be treaten justly and as equally as can be to best uphold and support equitable relationships between a customer and a business. A customer should not take advantage of a comapny through exploiting their terms, while a company should not exploit their users through their terms either. A just system should be one that holds companies accountable for adding unreasonable terms. For example, it was unpermissible for Disney to prevent all of their Disney+ users from going to court with Disney, although it seems fair to prevent Disney+ users from going to court with Disney specifically over some issue with Disney+.</li>
        </ul>
        The power dynamic at play is that the user wants to relinquish as few rights as possible, while the company wishes to gain as much freedom as possible. These two goals are, by definition, in  a conflict that can only be balance by collective movements, laws, and company policies. <br><br>

        All in all, Expecting the individual to read through every statement shown by every company he is associated with is unreasonable.So, the most effective way to balance this power dynamic is to hold companies accountable to the terms they set if they are too demanding, limiting, or detrimental to the user.
