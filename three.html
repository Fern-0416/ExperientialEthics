            &emsp;Earlier this year, a woman named Kanokpron Tangsuan ate at a restaurant in Disney's Orlando resort that was advertised to be allergen-free. She has a severe nut and dairy allergy, and tragically died of an allergic reaction from that restaurant. Her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, proceeded to sue Walt Disney Parks and Resorts over this incident. However, Disney responded with evidence of him signing up for a free trial of Disney+, whose TOS agreement states to settle any disputes out of court. <br>

            &emsp;Such a dispute has terrible implications: if it were to be successfully disputed, then all 153 million subscribers of Disney+ and more would be incapable of going to court against Disney for any reason. Fortunately however, Disney dropped this request in this request, recognizing the wrong done to Piccolo. See <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/nyregion/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-arbitration.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/nyregion/disney-arbitration-allergy-death-lawsuit.html">here</a> from NY Times<br>
            &emsp; This is a real example of how users can be taken advantage of through the fine print of TOS agreements, and companies should be held accountable for such absurd requests.

        &emsp;Of course, not all TOS agreements have ulterior motives and are evil; there are mutiple stakeholders, values, and power dynamics at play in this conflict with consent agreements. <br>
