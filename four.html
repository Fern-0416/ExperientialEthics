        The stakeholders in this issue are
    <hr id="miniL">

        <ul>
            <li>The user of a company's service: waivers the rights that the company outlines, is at risk of waivering more rights that he intended</li>
            <li>Those related to the user: In the Disney example, both the husband and the wife's families could benefit from the lawsuit money, and they would be in a worse position had the case been dropped due to having a free trial of Disney+</li>
            <li>The employyes and employers of the company: TOS and other types of agreements exist fundamentally to protect a company. However strong that protection is affects the well-being of that company</li>
            <li>The shareholders of said company: Once again, the well-being of the company affects it's stocks, value, and assets, which depends on the level of their protection</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <div id="miniB1">
        Some core values are:
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>Freedom: The freedom of the individual is intrinsically tied to his rights, and by signing consent agreements with businesses, he may lose some of his rights. To best satisfy this ethical lens, the individual should need to waver as few rights as possible within reason. Similarly, the freedom of a company is also constrained to their rights, although they actually gain freedom through these agreements. Ideally, this freedom is to provide users with end-to-end, smooth, and promised experiences/services without putting the service provider at jeopardy.
            </li>
            <li>Justice: Both the user and the company deserve to be treaten justly and as equally as can be to best uphold and support equitable relationships between a customer and a business. A customer should not take advantage of a comapny through exploiting their terms, while a company should not exploit their users through their terms either. A just system should be one that holds companies accountable for adding unreasonable terms.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <div id="miniEnd">
        &emsp;The power dynamic at play is that the user wants to relinquish as few rights as possible, while the company wishes to gain as much freedom as possible. These two goals are, by definition, in  a conflict that can only be balance by collective movements, laws, and company policies. <br><br>
        &emsp;All in all, Expecting the individual to read through every statement shown by every company he is associated with is unreasonable.So, the most effective way to balance this power dynamic is to hold companies accountable to the terms they set if they are too demanding, limiting, or detrimental to the user.
