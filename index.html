        &emsp;The following website is an explanation and analysis on the problems of consent on the internet. Many services, such as Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc. have terms of service (TOS) agreements that enable them to provide seamless, user-friendly experiences, at the cost of our data and possibly some of our rights. However, many people choose to ignore these statements and thoughtlessly agree to them, not knowing their contents and implications. <br> <br>
        &emsp;This behavior is not insensible, as we are often faced with so many TOS agreements, such that it is unreasonable to expect the signer to read all of them and keep up with their constant updates. <br><br>
        &emsp; So, this project will identify and analyze the ethical lenses behind TOS agreements, the values at play, and how it affects companies and users. This type of discussion is essential in shaping the future of the internet and how we coexist with it.
